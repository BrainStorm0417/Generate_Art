# Pt

A `Pt` represents a point in space, or more technically, an _n_-dimensional vector. You may also think of a Pt as an array of numeric values, or like an arrow coming from the origin point (0,0,0...). 

### Creating a Pt

You can create a `Pt` in different ways:
```
new Pt()
new Pt( 1, 2, 3, 4 )  
new Pt( [1,2,3] )
new Pt( {x:0, y:1, z:2, w:3} )
new Pt( anotherPt )
Pt.make( 5, 0 ) // same as new Pt(0,0,0,0,0)
```

`Pt` is implemented as a subclass of javascript's `Float32Array`. That means you may use all the `Float32Array` features on a `Pt` too. For example:
```
p[0]
pt.fill( 0, 1, 2 )
pt.reduce( (a,b) => Math.max(a,b), 0 );
```

##### Note that some `Float32Array` functions return a new `Float32Array`. You may cast it back to `Pt` by a simple wrapping:
```
new Pt( pt.slice(1,3) )
pt.$slice(1,3) // or alternatively, use $slice
``` 

### Updating values

Let's first look at how you may change a `Pt`'s values. It's like moving a Pt to another position. The simplest ways are to use `to` function or access the `x, y, z, w` properties:
```
pt.to(1,2,3)
pt.to( anotherPt )
p.w = p.x + p.z
```

### Calculating values
`Pt` provides functions for vector arithmetics, which is to say, you can perform calculations on arrays of values like adding or multiplying them. 
```
pt.add( 1, 2 )
pt.divide( 5 ) // divide each value by 5
pt.multiply( {x: 2, y: 1} )
pt.subtract( anotherPt ).multiply( 5 ).add( [1,2,3] )
```
The above functions will update the values of the object `pt`. If you want to get the results as a new Pt, using `$add` etc instead.
```
let s = pt.$add( 1,2,3 );
let b = pt.$multiply( 5 ).add( 1,2,3 )

```
There are other basic vector operations like `unit` (get a normalized vector), `magnitude` (get its distance from origin), `dot` (find dot product), `$project` (find its projection vector). Check the docs for a full list.

### Angles
Since a `Pt` can be thought of as an arrow from origin, you can find its angle with `angle` function. You can also find the angle between two `Pt`s with `angleBetween` function. A related function `toAngle()` lets you move a `Pt` by specifying a target angle.
```
pt.angle()
pt.angle(Const.yz) // get the angle of axis y-z
pt.angleBetween( anotherPt )
pt.toAngle( Math.PI/2 )
```

##### Note that all angles are specified in radian, where 180 degrees = _Ï€_ radian. You can use `Num.toRadian` and `Num.toDegree` functions to convert between degrees and radian.


### Transformations

If you use Illustrator or other graphics software, you'll probably know operations to rotate or scale a shape. Pt also provides these transformation functions:
```
pt.scale( 0.5 )
pt.rotate2D( Math.PI/3 )
pt.shear2D( [0.3, 1.2] )
pt.reflect2D( [p1, p2] ) 
```

If you want to transform from a specific anchor point instead of at (0,0), provide an anchor as the second parameter:
```
pt.scale( 0.5, anchorPt )
pt.rotate( Math.PI/3, anchorPt )
```

Another common way is to transform a `Pt` is to use `$map(...)` with a custom transform function. This is similar to Array's `map(...)` function. 
```
let np = pt.$map( (d) => d*d )
```

##### (Note that you may still use `map` but it will return a `Float32Array` instead of a `Pt`)
```
let np = new Pt( pt.map( (d) => d*d ) // same result as pt.$map(...)
```
