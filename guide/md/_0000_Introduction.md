# Pts

Pts is a new javascript libray that enables you to compose and visualize points in spaces. It revisited the ideas introduced in [Pt](https://medium.com/@williamngan/pt-93382bf5943e) (an experiment [library](https://williamngan.github.io/pt/) released 2 years ago), and revised its code and structure from the bottom up.

A point represents the smallest irreducible idea in the context of a space, and is expressed in a form. If it seems too abstract, imagine you are the first human on earth: At night, when you look upon a sky full of stars, what forms and meanings would you see in it? And by studying the compositions and movements of these twinkling dots, what kinds of new expressions could you envision? The goal of Pts is to let you experiment and express those conceptual points you see in your mind's eyes â€” as shapes, colors, motions, interactions, sounds, and more.

In terms of the library itself, Pts simplifies many of Pt's functions, and prefers composition over inheritance. It is written in typescript and compiled to es6 javascript. It's lightweight and structured so that you may easily incorporate all or part of it into your own projects.

The library is brand new and many new features are upcoming. Please give it a try, file bugs and pull requests, and ping [@williamngan](https://twitter.com/williamngan) if you have questions or feedbacks.

Now let's get started! Take a look at [**the demos**](../demo/index.html), and read [**the guides**](./Get-started-0100.html).
